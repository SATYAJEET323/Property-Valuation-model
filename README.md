Property valuation is a crucial aspect of real estate, finance, and investment, and traditional valuation methods often rely on expert opinions and historical data analysis. However, with the growing complexity of the real estate market and the increasing availability of vast amounts of unstructured data, it has become essential to explore innovative approaches that utilize modern techniques, such as Natural Language Processing (NLP). This project focuses on the application of NLP in property valuation models, aiming to enhance the accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability of these models in predicting property prices. By leveraging large datasets, including property descriptions, market trends, and public sentiment from online sources like real estate listings and social media, the proposed model seeks to uncover hidden patterns and relationships between various features that influence property values. The integration of NLP techniques, such as sentiment analysis, entity recognition, and text classification, allows for the extraction of valuable insights from textual data, improving traditional numerical-based valuation approaches. Ultimately, this project aims to contribute to the development of more robust and dynamic property valuation models that can assist investors, appraisers, and homeowners in making informed decisions based on real-time data and comprehensive market insights.
